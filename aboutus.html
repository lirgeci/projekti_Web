            <div class="p1">
                <p>iStudio began as a simple idea born from a passion for creating spaces that are both beautiful and
                    functional. The founders, inspired by the power of design to transform everyday life, started
                    working on small residential projects, learning and growing with each client interaction. Every home
                    and office taught them something new, shaping their approach and vision.
                    <br> <br>
                    As the team gained experience, Istudio expanded into larger and more diverse projects, including
                    modern offices and commercial spaces. The designers brought together their unique perspectives,
                    blending creativity with practicality, and quickly built a reputation for delivering thoughtful,
                    high-quality interiors that leave a lasting impression.
                    <br> <br>
                    Today, iStudio continues to push boundaries, combining modern aesthetics with timeless elegance.
                    Their mission is simple yet powerful: to create interiors that reflect individuality, enhance
                    lifestyles, and inspire those who experience them. Every project is a testament to their dedication,
                    creativity, and passion for design.</p>
